23-24: 4359 -- FUNDAMENTALS OF DATA ANALYSIS

Assessment Repo, by Ciaran Moran


## About
This repository contains the work that I have created for the varies tasks given.
The following tasks/questions have been researched and answers provided.

### tasks.ipynb
 1. The Collatz conjecture.
 2. Give an overview of the famous penguins data set.
 3. For each of the variables in the penguins data set,3 suggest what probability distribution from the numpy random distributions list is the most appropriate to model the variable.
 4. Suppose you are flipping two coins, each with a probability p of giving heads. Plot the entropy of the total number of heads versus p.
5. Create an appropriate individual plot for each of the variables in the penguin data set

### project.ipynb
Investigate the variables and data points within the well-known iris flower data set associated with Ronald A Fisher.
